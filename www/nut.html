<p> What is a macronutrient?</p>
<p> a macronutrient provides your body with calories/energy. There are three types of macronutritients; proteins, carbs and fats. <p/> 
 <p>What are good fats? <p/>
 
 <p> Good fats help control your hunger, while boosting your metabolism. They also lower your cholesterol helping you shed some pounds and also give you shiny and healthy nails and hair. <p>
<p> what are proteins?<p/>

<p> Proteins are the most important food to fuel your body to build muscle. Protein is a mcaronutrient, helping you build muscle mass. Many think of protein of being just animal meat but it can also be in other sources like nuts and legumes. <p/>

<p> Here is a list of some proteins that bodybuilding.com came up with for people to follow and get some great ideas! <p/>
